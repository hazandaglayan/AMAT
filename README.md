# AMAT
In direct exoplanet detection, existing algorithms use techniques based on a low-rank approximation to separate the rotating planet signal from the quasi-static speckles. We present a novel approach that iteratively finds the planetâ€™s flux and the low-rank approximation of quasi-static signals, strengthening the existing models.
